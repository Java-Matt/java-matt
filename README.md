## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maciej, and I'm a **Java developer** with a strong interest in backend development and modern software architecture. I enjoy building efficient systems and continuously expanding my knowledge in the world of software engineering.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a **microservices-based project** where Iâ€™m exploring **Keycloak** for authentication, **RabbitMQ** for message brokering, and integrating external APIs (e.g., currency exchange rates). This project is helping me deepen my understanding of distributed systems and event-driven architecture.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Jenkins** for CI/CD and starting to explore **Kubernetes** to get familiar with container orchestration. I also plan to begin learning **AWS** to expand my knowledge of cloud technologies.
- ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and always strive to learn new technologies and best practices to become a better developer.

### Tech Stack:
- **Languages**: Java 17, SQL
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Spring Boot, Hibernate, REST, JPA, JUnit, Mockito, Maven
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, RabbitMQ, MySQL
- **IDEs**: IntelliJ IDEA

### What I Bring to the Table:
- Solid understanding of **Java** and **Spring Boot** for building backend applications.
- Hands-on experience with **RESTful APIs**, **database design**, and **Docker**.
- A proactive approach to learning and improving my skills in software development.
- A growth mindset â€“ Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge.
